Assume that we are regressing the FIRST DIFFERENCED signal yd.
Then each signal has mean 0.

V_{i,i+h} = V_{i+h,i} is the mean, order h autocovariance of the first-differenced output signals y.

Each step is 5 minutes; we assume an 8-hour maximum window of influence, so that for h>96 we have 0 covariance.
